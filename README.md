# OpJuno-Maps

In January 2024 my partner said "I want to make a Battletech tournament that takes place on Juno Beach, during the landings! The players can play the invading and defending forces and try to take beaches! It's going to be fantastic!"
I immediately said "I'll make the maps!" even though this would be my first foray into map making. My partner has been playing Battletech for the last 30 years and has extensive experience organising community events, so I was sure that aspect was going to be an absolute success.

## Method (to the madness)

Starting with 1944-era Operation Neptune planning maps, we blocked out the portions of the terrain we wanted people to play on, leading to the Alpha versions of the maps. This took virtually no time at all. For the rest of the project, I would be hip deep in learning to use Inkscape, GIMP, creating various brushes, experimenting with drawing terrain then giving up and discovering NCAP's amazing repository of aerial photographs from the period and learning to stitch photographs together into collages that would form the base image of the map.

Then, colourising the grayscale image in Inkscape, finding a balance of colours based on the actual colours of Normandy seascape and terrain, adapting rivers and roads to the hexagonal overlay that Battletech demands and bashing my head against various visual and technical challenges encountered along the way.

The first set of maps went live in November 2024, in a tournament for 12 players that was a resounding success. We fundraised for the local Legion Hall and played at a local game shop. 

Second tournament was in June 2025, to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day. We fundraised for Wounded Warriors Canada and had 16 players in the tournament. I learned that creating code for matching players up needs to account for the inevitable encounter with human users and last minute changes, which is why my "Player matchup" code is not going to make it to this site :D

For the second tournament, we extended the player experience by creating more 3D printed terrain elements and Hero Cards of either historical individuals or composites that represented some of the people who were involved in the Allied side of the Operation Neptune. We tried to be representative of all branches of the military, including support personnel who may not have been at the front lines. I regret not having the full extent of the references I used to create the brief bios of the people we selected for the Hero Cards, but all of the information was available publicly as of June 2025.

## Goals

- revise maps to reduce visual complexity
- find a printing house that can screen print on neoprene for map sale -- contact me if you know of someone, our goal is to sell the maps for ~$70 CAD/doublesided map
